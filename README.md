# RVAgene: modeling gene expression dynamics 

### Overview
RVAgene models gene expression dynamics in single-cell or bulk data. Read the paper [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.375436v1).

### Requirements
1. Python 3
2. numpy, matplotlib, pytorch, scikit-learn, tqdm
3. GPU (optional)


### Quickstart
  - Jupyter notebook demo of RVAgene [here](https://github.com/maclean-lab/RVAgene/blob/master/demo.ipynb)
  - Jupyter notebook demo of processing bulk Single cell data and running RVAgene [here](https://github.com/maclean-lab/RVAgene/blob/master/single_cell_demo.ipynb)
  - Or on the command line
      - python gen_synthetic_data.py <dataset_name> e.g. `python gen_synthetic_data.py demosim`  
      - python train_and_gen.py <dataset_name> e.g. `python train_and_gen.py demosim`

### Model and training parameters:
`sequence_length`: length of the input sequence  <br />
`number_of_features` : number of features per timepoint per gene i.e. 1  <br />
`hidden_size`:  hidden size of the RNN <br />
`hidden_layer_depth`: number of layers in RNN (1 is enough) <br />
`latent_length`: latent vector length <br />
`batch_size`: number of genes in a single batch. IMPORTANT: last batch will be dropped is it is not a divisor of number of training genes. <br />
`learning_rate`: the learning rate of the module <br />
`n_epochs`: Number of iterations/epochs <br />
`dropout_rate`: The probability of a node being dropped-out <br />
`optimizer`: ADAM/ SGD optimizer to reduce the loss function <br />
`loss`: SmoothL1Loss / MSELoss / ReconLoss / any custom loss which inherits from `_Loss` class <br />
 boolean `cuda`: to be run on GPU or not <br />
`print_every`: The number of iterations after which loss should be printed for each epoch <br />
boolean `clip`: Gradient clipping to overcome explosion <br />
`max_grad_norm`: The grad-norm to be clipped if using clipping <br />
`dload`: Download directory where models are to be dumped <br />
`log_file`: File to log training loss , default None i.e. STDOUT <br />
